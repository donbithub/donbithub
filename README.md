## Don's Github page
Hello, my name is Don and I'm a talented front-end web developer. This readme is meant to showcase all the projects I've worked on, and possibly also to showcase what I'm working on at the moment. It's still a work in progress, so I'll be updating it as time goes on!

### Projects

#### SecDesk Security Management System
This was my biggest project that I worked on with 2 other students. We made a web app that a security company could use to deliver complex data to their customers in a more user-friendly way.

#### Co-Flora website: https://coflora.netlify.app/
Currently I'm working on a new website for Co-Flora, which is a eco-friendly company that sells cork products. It's not on their domain yet. I also didn't make the header, footer, contact page, or the about us page. (Done by other students)

#### Doncancode website
I'm also working on my own website, where I want to showcase all my projects in a less Github-readme way. It's called Doncancode. Because my name is Doncan... and I can code... haha, get it?
